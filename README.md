# Random-HorrorMovie-Picker

This is for the horror fan that just can't decide what to watch. I wanted to build a project that would a) help me understand what I was learning better and b) something that I was 
passionate and excited about so that I would really get into it. 

This "app" allows you to randomly pick a movie from a hard coded list of a list of your choosing. It's just for fun, but building it was engaging and at times challenging.
One of the biggest challenges I faced building this app was attempting to get the local storage to work properly with the site. A lot of trial and error and reaching out to fellow
developers and eventually I was able to fix the bugs.

Built with:
HTML
CSS
Javascript

Licenced fonts used, not for commercial use. For educational purposes and fun.
